==================
Generalized Forces
==================

At this point we have the three primary ingredients to formulate the equations
of motion of a multibody system:

1. Angular and Translational Kinematics
2. Mass and Mass Distribution
3. Forces, Moments, and Torques



Partial Velocities

Generalized Active Forces
=========================

Generalized Inertia Forces
